# DatabaseLogger

This DatabaseLogger is a class library that represents a simple engine for saving a log in a SQL table. The engine assumes that the database and sql user credentials were already set.
The connectionstring is defined in an **app.config** file:

* `app.config` -- (I)

Also, the unit tests consider the path defined in the app.config for creating the SQL connection. The log is saved using stored procedures.

Any concern or improvement, is well received.
